<p>Big Honking Button is, well, a big button that honks. Okay, that's not all- itâ€™s actually a simple sampler in a very silly package. It has pitch CV, gate in, gate out, and you can store up to 4mb of samples on it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-support-and-help">Getting support and help<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-support-and-help" referrerpolicy="origin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>We want you to have a wonderful experience with your module. If you need help or run into problems, please reach out to us. Email is the best way for product issues, whereas Discord and GitHub are great for getting advice and help on how to customize your module.</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-module">Installing the module<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-the-module" referrerpolicy="origin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>To install this into your Eurorack setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect a Eurorack power cable to your power supply and the back of the module. <strong>Note that even though the power connector on the module is keyed, double check that the red stripe is on the side labeled <code>red stripe</code>!</strong></li>
<li>Screw the module to your rack's rails.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="inputs-and-outputs">Inputs and outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#inputs-and-outputs" referrerpolicy="origin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><img alt="images/honk-program-labels.png" src="images/honk-program-labels.png" /></p>
<p>Big Honking Button has two inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gate / trigger in</li>
<li>A pitch CV in that is 1v/Oct with a -5v to +5v range<sup>see note</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>And two outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gate / trigger out (0v or 5v)</li>
<li>An audio out</li>
</ul>
<p>With the default code, it will trigger the sample and play it through the audio out whenever the button is pressed or whenever the gate input is triggered. It will also set the gate out to high whenever the button is pressed or whenever the gate in is high. You can customize some of this behavior by <a href="#modifying-the-code" referrerpolicy="origin">modifying the code</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Revision differences</p>
</div>
<p>Big Honking Buttons manufactured prior to 2021 (v4 and lower) only have an input range of -2v to +2v. More than that won't damage the module, but it won't be able to measure anything outside of that range.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-sample">Changing the sample<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-sample" referrerpolicy="origin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>You can change the sample on Big Honking Button by connecting it to your computer via a micro USB cable. The USB port is located on the module's main circuit board, located under the panel. Please note that you do have to power the module in order for the USB connection to work (the module itself can <strong>not</strong> be powered over USB alone).</p>
<p>Samples must be in mono, 16-bit, 44.1kHz, signed <code>wav</code> files. Adafruit has an <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-wave-shield-audio-shield-for-arduino/convert-files" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent guide on how to convert sound files</a>, though your sample can be 44.1kHz and not 22kHz.</p>
<p>To modify the sample that plays:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the Big Honking Button to your computer using a micro USB cable. It should show up as a small external drive named <code>CIRCUITPY</code></li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>samples</code> folder in the drive</li>
<li>Rename or delete the existing <code>honk.wav</code> file</li>
<li>Copy your sample over and rename it to <code>honk.wav</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Your Big Honking Button will reboot and then it should play the new sample! If you run into trouble, please <a href="#getting-support-and-help" referrerpolicy="origin">reach out</a>.</p>
<p>You can store and play multiple samples on the Big Honking Button, but to do that, you'll need to learn how to modify some of the code - don't worry! It's not too hard.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-the-code">Modifying the code<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-the-code" referrerpolicy="origin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>When connected to your computer, Big Honking Button shows up as a small drive named <code>CIRCUITPY</code>. In that drive, you should find a file named <code>code.py</code>. Big Honking Button runs <a href="https://circuitpython.org" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CircuitPython</a> which means that its firmware is written in the approachable <a href="https://python.org" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Python</a> programming language and you don't need any special knowledge or compilers to make changes to it. So, open up that file in your favorite text editor, we're going to make some changes!</p>
<p>If you don't have a text editor - that's okay! While you could use Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), these can sometimes have issues with CircuitPython devices like Big Honking Button. I'd recommend <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">installing Mu</a> if you're new to this whole world. You can read more about editing code for CircuitPython in <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/creating-and-editing-code" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adafruit's guide</a>.</p>
<p>As a way to get your feet let's change how the Big Honking Button behaves. By default, when you press the button it plays the <em>entire</em> sample, even if you release the button while the sample is still playing (this is <strong>trigger mode</strong>). This will make it where the sample will stop as soon as you let go of the button (or <strong>gate</strong> mode).</p>
<p>In the <code>code.py</code> you should see some code that looks like this (it's at the bottom):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bhb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">released</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">bhb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gate_out</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">False</span>
    <span class="c1"># Uncomment the call to stop to make the sample</span>
    <span class="c1"># stop playing as soon as you release the button.</span>
    <span class="c1"># bhb.stop()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Modify this code so that it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bhb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">released</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">bhb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gate_out</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">False</span>
    <span class="c1"># Uncomment the call to stop to make the sample</span>
    <span class="c1"># stop playing as soon as you release the button.</span>
    <span class="n">bhb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stop</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Be careful</p>
<p>Python is <em>whitespace-sensitive</em>. That means tabs and spaces are important! Make sure that you don't accidentally change the indentation level of this line.</p>
</div>
<p>Okay, save the file! Your Big Honking Button should restart and now it should stop the sample as soon as you let go of the button, try pressing it rapidly to see the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Congrats</strong>, you've made your first change to how the module works! ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>Big Honking Button can store multiple samples and you can use various means to change how they're triggered. We'll be adding a sample showing just that soon, but don't be afraid to experiment and reach out if you need any help!</p>
<p>If you want to you can learn more about <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CircuitPython</a> to the most of your module.

<p>There's probably some sort of error in the program. Don't worry, you can get it figured out.</p>
<p>If you connect using the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">serial console</a> you should be able to see the error. If you don't see it right away, you might need to reset the board (either by pressing the little button on the bottom of the module or power cycling your synth). Sometimes you can press <code>Ctrl+C</code> followed by <code>Ctrl+D</code> in the serial console to get the board to reset and tell you the error.</p>
